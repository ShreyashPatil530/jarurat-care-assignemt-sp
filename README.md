⚕️ HealthLink Pro - NGO Management System
VersionStatusHTMLCSSJS

HealthLink Pro is a fully functional, concept-level web application designed to assist Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in managing healthcare operations. It bridges the gap between patients seeking aid and volunteers offering support, equipped with real-time analytics and automated assistance.

🌟 Project Features
This application is a complete end-to-end prototype demonstrating modern front-end capabilities:

1. Dual Registration System
Patient Support: A form allowing patients to submit requests for medicine, doctor appointments, or emergency triage.
Volunteer Network: A registration module for volunteers to sign up, listing their skills (Driver, Doctor, Nurse, Logistics).
2. Real-Time Analytics Dashboard
Interactive Charts: Integrated Chart.js to visualize the distribution of patient needs.
Dynamic Updates: The chart updates instantly when a new patient request is submitted, providing immediate visual feedback to administrators.
3. Interactive Data Directory
Live Search: A fully functional search bar that filters the patient list by name instantly using JavaScript.
Status Tracking: Visual badges indicating if a request is "Pending" or "Done".
4. AI Chatbot ("HealthBot")
Automated Support: A floating chat widget that answers common questions.
Smart Routing: Uses rule-based logic to detect keywords (like "volunteer" or "medicine") and guides users to the correct forms.
5. Responsive Design
Fully responsive layout that works seamlessly on Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile devices.
🛠 Tech Stack

HTML5: Semantic markup for accessibility.
CSS3: Custom CSS with Flexbox/Grid, CSS Variables, and animations.
JavaScript (Vanilla): For logic, DOM manipulation, and interactivity.
Chart.js: External library (loaded via CDN) for data visualization.
